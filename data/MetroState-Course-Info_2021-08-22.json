The class addresses questions such as the following: Why has gender been an organizing principle of society?  How do different expectations for men and women emerge in different societies and historical periods? How do race and sexuality influence and differently shape our experiences of gender?  How do we explain the sexual division of labor and the unequal status of women?  Close attention will be paid to the connection between social structure and human agency: how are people's lived experiences both shaped and limited by social forces, and how is experience reshaped or reproduced through human action?

A history of the world must be more than a mere compendium of facts about disparate societies and traditions.  In this course students study the interactions among far-flung civilizations in ancient and medieval times.  However, for most of the period considered in this course, those interactions were quite limited.  Therefore, a coherent account of human history as a whole before the modern era emerges in large measure from comparisons among independently developing societies, and from a search for common patterns of development.  Both similarities and important differences receive due attention.  Topics include: the change from hunter-gatherer societies to sedentary agriculture; the rise of cities, social stratification, and the beginnings of written culture and organized religion; the complex civilizations and empires of West Asia, East Asia, Africa, Mesoamerica, and Europe; gender relations across civilizations in the ancient world; and the beginnings of technological and cultural divergence in the medieval world.",

American Indian tribes are soveregn nations. Students will explore how Euro-Americans used the construct of race as a tool during the process of settler colonialism to diminish and erase tribal sovereignty and avoid recognizing tribes¿ inherit power as politically sovereign entities. Throughout this relationship the legalistic erosion of tribal sovereignty was paired with genocidal policies including wars of removal, forced assimilation through the use of boarding schools, and other acts of ethnocide that continue to contribute to contemporary issues in Native Americans communities. Despite these settler colonial actions, tribal governments and Native American peoples continue to survive, persist, and work for cultural revitalization. Class discussions will address, among other issues, the impact of settler colonialism, including how the concept of race homogenized the over 500 distinct culturals and histories into a single concept of ¿American Indian,¿ the responses of individuals, communities, and institutions to historical and contemporary forms of racism that still affect descendents today, and contemporary issues including efforts to diminish Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), environmental racism, and the impact of historical trauma.

This independent study is a critical and analytical exploration of the history of America's past leaders.  Periodically historians are surveyed to determine how they \"rank\" the American presidents.  Among the issues considered are why presidents have been ranked as they have, and whether these rankings reflect reasonable judgments of their accomplishments in office.  As students read about these men-for that is what they always have been-they should what constitutes political success, and why people remember some presidents as \"great,\" and others as failures.

  "description": "This course surveys the history of environmentalism in America over the last 100 years.  Students are introduced to the ideas of the environmentalists-from Theodore Roosevelt and Rachel Carson to EarthFirst!'s Dave Foreman and Vice President Al Gore-about wilderness preservation, resource conservation, public health and, fundamentally, about the proper relationship between humans and the natural world.  Environmentalist thought and actions are considered in the context of ecological and resource crises (such as the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the oil crisis of the 1970s), of problems created by technological applications (such as the widespread use of DDT) and of particular cultural developments (such as the closing of the \"frontier\" at the turn of the century and the growth of the counterculture in the 1960s).\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrerequisites\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWRIT 131: Writing I",

The course will emphasize the tension between two ideological perspectives on the role of government. Should government function primarily to ensure collective rights and provide social control or to protect individual rights and liberties?  These two perspectives on the function of government are evident in the shaping of law and public policy over the course of U.S. history. Students will learn how the concepts of individualism, rights, and equality have changed over time and how collective behavior and social movements have recast constitutional principles and judicial practices. We will explore these concepts and developments through consideration of the following subjects: commerce and the industrial state, civil rights and civil liberties, women and citizenship, and liberal versus conservative constitutionalism.",

In addition to learning the specialized vocabulary and skills involved in the analysis of works from a variety of artistic genres, students will learn how Harlem's leading black intellectuals tied aesthetic theories to social and racialized principles of artistic production, inspiring some artists while prompting others to openly rebel. Given that the Harlem Renaissance is not characterized by any one style, technique, or manifesto, well pay special attention to connections among the artists in an effort to determine how and whether the Harlem Renaissance is a coherent and unified movement across the arts.

  "description": "The field of computer science is experiencing a transition from processing-intensive to data-intensive problems, wherein data is produced in massive amounts by large sensor networks, simulations, and social networks. Efficiently extracting, interpreting, and learning from these very large data sets need different storage and processing requirements compared to traditional business applications that are mostly dependent on relational database management systems. These emerging data-intensive applications require heavy read/write workloads and do not need some of the stringent schema and ACID properties that are central to relational databases. To cope with these requirements, a new genre of large-scale systems, is introduced that is called NoSQL databases. The main characteristics of NoSQL databases are that they are open source, non-schema oriented, having weak consistency properties and heavily distributed over large and clusters of commodity hardware. In this course, we will cover the basic concepts and approaches that are used by such big-data systems. Students will gain hands-on experience by solving relevant problems through projects utilizing publicly available systems. Topics covered includes: fundamentals of big data storage and processing using Hadoop, distributed file systems, and map-reduce, fundamentals of the four categories of NoSQL systems, namely kay-value stores, document stores, column stores, and graph stores.

  "description": "Researchers define turning points as a \"major transformation in views about the self, identity or the meaning of life.\" They occur as new things are learned, rendering us amenable to change, and produce perceived, long-lasting redirection in the path of a one's life. Psychologists associate turning points with transitions and stages of human development defined and explored by Erik Erikson. Ignoring uplifting turning points and with distressing turning points in mind, the philosopher Frederick Nietzsche wrote \"that which does not kill us makes us stronger.\" Retirement or loss of retirement income, end of a love affair, reaching the \"golden years\" (maturity) or learning that one (or a family member) has a fatal disease are examples of turning points. Portrayals, in film and literature, of individuals coping with obstacles to happiness or overcoming adversity dramatize turning points. Rhetorical, films and literature are cultural artifacts that comfort, guide generations and teach us how to live! Lessons learned from contemporary films and classical literature are a primary focus of this course.",

Among others, students are expected to engage with and identify, synthesize and evaluate relevant scholarly works. As such, the course will also emphasize the study and research skills and methods needed to conduct a final research and/or creative project. \n\nFurther, students are expected to develop a focus that will provide direction and organization for their educational plans. Students will investigate courses offered throughout Metro State to shape that focus and tentatively outline final projects that will demonstrate their multidisciplinary learning. The course will introduce students to the nature of individualized study and the significance of interdisciplinary studies.\n\nDuring this course students will also consult with their advisor and instructor to decide whether they will pursue a Master of Arts (MA) or a Master of Science (MS). The decision will depend on the area of focus and the coursework that will be selected. While the conversation about a particular path starts in this course, students can make adjustments as they continue their coursework and through consultations with faculty.\n\nBy the end of IDST600, students will submit a plan of study that outlines their focus areas and associated learning. The approval of this plan, including the relevance and appropriateness of associated learning, is at the discretion of the faculty. A faculty committee will have final approval responsibility for both students' plans and final projects, prior to registration for IDST 699.",

We will also discuss how the study of Asian American literature benefits from understanding broader historical and political issues relevant to the Asian American experience. To this end, we will read and discuss relevant primary texts and secondary criticism on topics such as (but not limited to), law, citizenship, labor, imperialism, war, anti-Asian racism, comparative racialization, queer identities and activism to deepen our understanding of the connection between the aesthetics and socio-political insights of Asian American literature.

Then we examine ethics in government, looking at the systems established to insure not that actors on the governmental stage do the right thing, but rather that they avoid the appearance of a conflict.  The exercise in developing the code will combine these two ethical systems, one normative and the other procedural, in a single proscriptive document.

  "description": "Mathematical modeling is the process of using mathematics and computational tools to gain insights into complex problems arising in the sciences, business, industry, and society.  Mathematical modeling is an iterative process which involves a computational approach to the scientific method.  Assumptions are established, a mathematical structure consistent with those assumptions is developed, hypotheses are produced and tested against empirical evidence, and then the model is refined accordingly. The quality of these models is examined as part of the verification process, and the entire cycle repeats as improvements and adjustments to the model are made.  This course provides an introduction to both the mathematical modeling process as well as deterministic and stochastic methods that are commonly employed to investigate time-dependent phenomena.\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrerequisites\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMATH 211: Calculus II and \t\t\t\tSTAT 201: Statistics I\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n        \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecial information\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            Note:  Students whose prerequisites are not identified by the system should contact the Math and Statistics department for an override at MATH@metrostate.edu.",

A Capability map shows what your organization actually does to build the products or provide the services.  The map will not tell you How it is done, but it will help you map the complexity of the processes and systems that make-up your organization.  Although complex, mapping makes it easier to see redundancies that exist in a current state so that you can align resources and transition to a future state.  An organizational capability map combined with a solid maturity assessment allows an organization to focus on the things that will be most impactful to the strategy. This critical focus helps the organization invest the right resources and energy on the right things at the right time.\n      \n\t        \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecial information\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            Fee: $150.",

This course will adapt the study of leadership and organizations to the unique obligations, functions, processes, and public values and societal outcomes that govern the decisions of the government and nonprofit sectors.\n\nPublic service is the result of the work of local, state, and federal government; regional compacts or special districts; tribal governments; nonprofit organizations and social enterprises; partnerships between government and business; and international linkages (that are necessary for solving global problems likes pandemics and climate change) . The public service perspective is evident when government and civil society collectively marshal efforts to respond to human-made (9-11 Terrorist Attacks, Aurora, Colorado Theater Mass Shooting) and natural (Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy) disasters and public health emergencies (COVID-19 outbreak).  The public service sector does not shut down during times of wars, terrorist attacks, disasters, and public health emergencies and epidemics.\n\nPublic service organizations are fundamentally different from profit-seeking firms. They are organized to provide socially valuable goods and services, e.g., public education, social services for the unemployed and the homeless, child protection services, crime-fighting, disaster response, natural resource and environmental protection, climate change response, homeland security, and public health emergency response.  They are, above all, governed by our democratic and rights-based traditions and culture. Accordingly, the government and the nonprofit sectors operate under greater public scrutiny and with unique public expectations for openness, transparency, honesty, accountability, public deliberation, citizen engagement, fairness and equity, and the pursuit of other public values that we deem\nimportant as a society.\n\nGovernment and many nonprofits, the most important actors in the public service sector, work hand-in-glove to deliver vital public goods and services and engage citizens and volunteers towards public ends. This course focuses on how public and nonprofit managers and leaders mobilize resources to achieve important public purposes. Students will be exposed to insights and best practices, with emphasis on public service, and learn the skills to develop into a capable leader.\n      \n\t        \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecial information\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            Note:  If you have completed MGMT 620 Organizational Behavior, do not register for this course.",

  "description": "This course introduces MPNA, MPA, MNLM, and other Metro State graduate students to the application of the principles and methods of economic analysis to the policy, management, and operational decisions faced by public administrators, nonprofit managers, social entrepreneurs, and other public service professionals.\n\nPublic and nonprofit organizations (hereinafter referred to as not-for-profit organizations) are fundamentally different from profit-seeking firms.  They are organized to provide socially valuable goods and services (e.g., public education, socials services for the unemployed) independent of the revenues they receive from the sale of their products.  While surpluses and profits can support their social missions, not-for-profit organizations do not intend to maximize these surpluses/profits.  Because not-for-profit organizations use scarce resources from taxpayers, donors, volunteers, and other external stakeholders, they also operate under greater public scrutiny and with unique public expectations for openness/transparency, honesty, accountability, and fairness.  \n\nThis course will explain how managers and leaders of public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and social enterprises can apply economic analysis and reasoning in the complex task of effectively providing social goods and services, taking into primary consideration the fundamentally different social and political goals, internal constraints, and external authorizing environments faced by not-for-profit organizations.  \n\nMPNA 635 will also improve the economic literacy of public and nonprofit professionals in discussing and defending their respective positions on a public policy issue or controversy.  \n\nCompetence Statement\nStudents will understand the fundamental concepts and methods of economic analysis and critically appraise and adapt them to the context of policy analysis, public administration, nonprofit management, social entrepreneurship, political advocacy, criminal justice and law enforcement, and other related public service professional fields.",

  "description": "Symbolic logic uses formal methods in order to study the properties of arguments in a precise and rigorous manner.  In this course, we learn about both the propositional calculus, which deals with the logical relations that hold among whole propositions, and the predicate calculus, a system which allows more precise analysis of linguistic structure.  The course will focus on both translation of natural languages into symbolic form, and proofs using natural deduction.",

Can we know when something is right or wrong or this only a matter of personal feeling?  Do the affluent have moral duties to help the poor of the world with their plight? This course explores these questions and others like them, using a variety of philosophical materials and approaches. It examines major moral theories and related moral dilemmas concerning, for example abortion, economic justice, war and morality, and the moral status of animals. This course also examines ideas about how race, class and gender may affect concepts of ethics.",

What does it mean to have a sexual identity?  Is there such a thing as \"normal\" sex?  How has sexuality been socially regulated in the past and how is it currently regulated?  How can people evaluate such \"regulations\"?  How do ideas about sexuality influence gender, ethnic, racial and other stereotypes?  What sorts of ideas do people have about the nature of their bodies?  Students develop basic philosophical skills in order to sort out these questions.  Topics usually include: eroticism, desire, homophobia, sexual violence, pornography, prostitution, and sexual imagery in popular culture, love and romance.",

  "description": "This course will consider a number of questions about knowledge: What is the difference between knowing that something is true and just believing (or being of the opinion) that it is true?  What sorts of methods or modes of inquiry can reliably produce knowledge?  Are there various methods for acquiring knowledge or is there really only one method (perhaps something called \"the scientific method\").  Is science the only reliable 'way of knowing', or are their others (faith or intuition or personal experience or...)?  Should we accept claims that non-Western cultures have distinctive 'ways of knowing'?  What about the idea that there are (as a popular book title suggests) 'women's ways of knowing'?  The course will treat these questions as practical questions: In the public sphere of politics and the marketplace, as well as in our personal lives, claims and counter-claims abound.  Many people claim to know one thing or another, and many others claim to know that those very claims are false or ill founded.  How can we sort through the spin and the propaganda and figure out what's really going on?  How, in particular, can we know what we need to know in order to be good citizens in a democratic society?  Part of what we need is to understand better how our minds work and what errors they are prone to.  We will also need to think about how the mass media inform and misinform us.",

Should we expect religious beliefs to be supported by evidence or reasons or does faith operate in a different way?  Are there good arguments for (or against) the existence of God?  Of miracles?  Of the immortality of the soul?  Do religious accounts of events (of the creation of the world, for example) compete with scientific explanations?

We will look closely at the grounds for claiming that we have obligations and duties in relation to non-human animals and the environment, as well as the ways in which these relations provide inspiration, companionship, solace and love.  \n\nTopics may include: environmental justice and the disposal of electronic waste; animals and factory farming; the real cost of cheap consumer goods; the historical evolution of the concept of environment protection, of a land ethic, and of the development of natural parks; human stewardship;  the possibility that natural creatures have a value that is independent of human benefit and whether it makes sense to grant them legal standing; global climate change; the connections between feminism and environmental ethics; the population time bomb and current responses; green politics; the role of scientific expertise in a democratic society; shallow vs deep environmental movements.",

What are their responsibilities, if any, to their employees, their customers, and the wider community?  Is it enough to obey the law, or does the law sometimes allow people to do things that are wrong?  Do employees have any right to privacy on the job?  To 'living wages'?  To 'decent' working conditions? Does a seller have any obligation to look out for the interests of the buyer?  Isn't it necessary to put the best possible 'spin' on your product and let the buyer look out for him or herself?  This course will examine questions like these in light of various theories of ethics and current theories of justice.  In addition to considering how we might ideally like people to act, it will also consider the challenges to personal integrity and 'doing the right thing' posed by the real world of business and by the kind of large bureaucratic organizations that dominate it.",

This course will use ethical theories and theories of justice to explore these questions and others like them.

We share our social and cultural environments with a wide variety of non-human animals and for a wide variety of purposes. We domesticate animals and use them for food, clothing, entertainment, and transportation. We hunt them for subsistence and sport. We worship, sacrifice, display, vilify, cherish, and study them. In this course, we will explore questions regarding the intersection of the lives of human and non-human animals from a sociological perspective. Potential questions we will examine include: Why do we love some animals to the point of considering them family members, but vilify and even eat others? Are pets--like the dog currently sleeping by my side--monsters of dependence created by human oppression, or do pets and people co-exist interdependently? Is human perception and treatment of non-human animals related in significant ways to such enduring social problems as racism, sexism, settler colonialism, and violence against vulnerable groups? These are difficult questions. Our aim in this course is not to come to a consensus, but rather to consider a variety of perspectives and develop our own logical and evidence-based arguments regarding these matters.

Most of the field experience hours will be determined by field-based assignments required in UTP SPED courses, especially SPED 603 or SPED 601 for conducting a variety of special education assessments. However, field experiences can include work needed for other SPED courses as needed to fulfill field experience requirements. Urban SPED teacher candidates will have opportunity to apply knowledge, theories and skills in their placement(s) as they progress through coursework. Successful completion of this practicum is a prerequisite for student teaching. \nPrerequisite(s): SPED 600: Foundations of Urban Special Education. Co requisite: SPED 603: Special Education Assessment. Other Information: Full admission to Urban Special Education Program or Department approval required to register. Students may register for 0, 1 or 2 credit(s) depending on personal circumstances; but the practicum requirements are the same. Placements are made or approved in collaboration with the instructor of SPED 603 and the Urban Teacher Program Field Experience Coordinator. Participation in 4 reflective seminars with other students is also required for this course and will held in connection with SPED 603.",
